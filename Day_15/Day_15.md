# Day 15 of 100 - 100 Days of Code Challenge

## üìù Overview
Welcome to **Day 15** of my **100 Days of Code Challenge**! Today, I implemented a Java program that checks whether a given number is a **strong number** and also identifies all strong numbers within a specified range. This problem helped me understand **factorial calculations** and practice working with **loops** and **conditional statements**.

## ‚úÖ What I did today
- Implemented a Java program to check if a number is a **strong number**.
- Extended the program to find all strong numbers within a given range.

## üíª Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Concepts:** Loops, Factorial Calculation, Strong Number, Conditional Statements

## üìñ Problem Description
- A **strong number** is a number in which the sum of the factorials of each digit equals the number itself. For example, `145` is a strong number because:
  \[
  1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145
  \]
- The task is to:
  - Check if a given number is a strong number.
  - Find all strong numbers within a specified range.

### Input/Output Example:
1. **Single Number Check**:
   - Input: `145`
   - Output: `145 is a strong number.`
2. **Range Check**:
   - Input: `1 to 200`
   - Output: `Strong numbers between 1 and 200: 1 2 145`

## üìù Code Example

```java
package dsa;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class pro_26 {
    
    // Method to calculate the factorial of a digit
    public static int factorial(int n) {
        int fact = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            fact *= i;
        }
        return fact;
    }

    // Method to check if a number is a strong number
    public static boolean isStrongNumber(int number) {
        int sum = 0, temp = number;
        
        while (temp > 0) {
            int digit = temp % 10;
            sum += factorial(digit);
            temp /= 10;
        }
        
        return sum == number;
    }

    // Method to find and print all strong numbers in a given range
    public static void findStrongNumbersInRange(int start, int end) {
        System.out.println("Strong numbers between " + start + " and " + end + ":");
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            if (isStrongNumber(i)) {
                System.out.print(i + " ");
            }
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Taking user input for a single number check
        System.out.print("Enter a number to check if it's a strong number: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();
        
        if (isStrongNumber(number)) {
            System.out.println(number + " is a strong number.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(number + " is not a strong number.");
        }
        
        // Taking user input for range to find all strong numbers within it
        System.out.print("Enter the start of the range: ");
        int start = scanner.nextInt();
        
        System.out.print("Enter the end of the range: ");
        int end = scanner.nextInt();
        
        findStrongNumbersInRange(start, end);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Program Output

Enter a number to check if it's a strong number: 
145
145 is a strong number.

Enter the start of the range: 
1
Enter the end of the range: 
200
Strong numbers between 1 and 200:
1 2 145

### üìö Lessons Learned
Learned to calculate factorials of digits and sum them to check for strong numbers.
Practiced writing modular methods to separate concerns (checking single numbers and finding numbers in a range).
Gained further experience with loops and conditional checks in Java.

---

### ‚ö° Challenges
Calculating the factorial of each digit repeatedly required careful handling to ensure performance efficiency.
