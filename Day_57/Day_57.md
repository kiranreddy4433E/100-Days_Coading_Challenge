# Day 57 of 100 - 100 Days of Code Challenge

## üìù Overview
Welcome to **Day 57** of my **100 Days of Code Challenge**! Today, I implemented a Java program to determine whether a student passes or fails a test based on the scoring system of correct and incorrect answers. This problem was engaging and helped me practice handling multiple test cases and arithmetic operations.

## ‚úÖ What I did today
-"Pass or Fail

Anusree is struggling to pass a certain college course.
The test has a total of N question, each question carries 3 marks for a correct answer and ‚àí1 for an incorrect answer. Anusree is a risk-averse person so he decided to attempt all the questions. It is known that Anusree got X questions correct and the rest of them incorrect. For Anusree to pass the course he must score at least P marks.
Will Anusree be able to pass the exam or not?
Input Format
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, three integers N, X, P.
Output Format
For each test case output ""PASS"" if Chef passes the exam and ""FAIL"" if Chef fails the exam.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings ""pAas"", ""pass"", ""Pass"" and ""PASS"" will all be treated as identical).


- Wrote a Java program to:
  1. Input the total number of test cases.
  2. For each test case, calculate the total score based on correct and incorrect answers.
  3. Determine if the student passes or fails based on the minimum passing marks.
- Practiced logical conditions, loops, and input handling.

## üíª Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Concepts:** Conditional Statements, Loops, Arithmetic Operations

## üìñ Problem Description
- **Input**:
  - `T`: Number of test cases.
  - For each test case:
    - `N`: Total number of questions.
    - `X`: Number of correctly answered questions.
    - `P`: Minimum marks required to pass.
- **Scoring System**:
  - Correct answer: `+3` marks.
  - Incorrect answer: `‚àí1` mark.
- **Output**:
  - Print `"PASS"` if the total marks are at least `P`, otherwise print `"FAIL"`.

#### Example 1:
**Input**:
Number of test cases: 2 Enter N, X, and P for test case 1: 5 3 7 Enter N, X, and P for test case 2: 4 2 5



**Output**:
PASS FAIL



#### Example 2:
**Input**:

## üìù Code Example

```java
package coading_Challange;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Day_57 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Number of test cases: ");
        int T = input.nextInt();

        for (int i = 0; i < T; i++) {
            System.out.println("Enter N, X, and P for test case " + (i + 1) + ":");
            int N = input.nextInt();
            int X = input.nextInt();
            int P = input.nextInt();

            int marks_CQuestions = 3 * X; // Marks for correct answers
            int marks_Wanswers = -(N - X); // Marks for incorrect answers
            int total_Marks = marks_CQuestions + marks_Wanswers;

            if (total_Marks >= P) {
                System.out.println("PASS");
            } else {
                System.out.println("FAIL");
            }
        }

        input.close();
    }
}
